Volatility breakout strategy for beginners in trading,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4s8pEniu2Y,X4s8pEniu2Y,"In this video, Algo trader Aseem Singhal explains a simple volatility-based trading concept that was backtested.

Core Idea (Backtested):

If today’s volatility is greater than the past 14 days, then buy on a green candle or sell on a red candle, and exit at the next day’s open.

What we cover:

Cumulative PnL / equity curve
PnL distribution by trade type (long vs short)
Monthly drawdown analysis & recovery
Volatility ↔ Profitability: does higher vol translate to better returns?

What backtesting tells about chart patterns ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YhXikBY9HQ,8YhXikBY9HQ,"In this video, we explore whether market candles are truly independent of prior candles.  

If you flip a coin and get five heads in a row, does that change the probability of the next flip being heads or tails? 

With this context in mind, we look at the Nifty, which has just formed seven consecutive red candles. 

Does this increase the chance of a green candle next, or are market moves independent events? To answer this, we present backtested data and reveal what history really tells us.

Beginner’s Guide to Systematic Trading (2025) | Learn Algorithmic Trading with Rakesh Pujara,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg9m0coQQ5I,pg9m0coQQ5I,"If you’ve ever wondered how professional traders actually approach the markets, this video is for you. In this conversation, seasoned trader Rakesh Pujara walks us through the world of systematic trading — starting from the basics and gradually building up to more advanced ideas.
We begin with the role of algorithms in trading, then move into practical concepts like backtesting, expectancy, and Monte Carlo simulations to make your strategies more robust. Rakesh also explains why trying to time the market rarely works, and how instead you can apply algorithms to make decisions in a more disciplined way.
From there, we dive into trading strategies, the four pillars of returns, and why diversification and non-correlation matter. Risk management is another big part of the discussion — with insights on leverage, hedging, and how to put everything together into a complete trading framework.
By the end, you’ll have a clear picture of how systematic trading works and what it takes to start thinking like a process-driven trader. Whether you’re completely new or already exploring algorithmic trading, this session will give you practical takeaways to use on your journey.

What They're Not Telling You About Option Trading Risks,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJV3H29KeS4,sJV3H29KeS4,"In this episode, Raghav Malik shares how institutions truly approach options trading. He breaks down what the real edge in trading is, and why luck may help in the short term, but only skill ensures success in the long run.

Raghav emphasizes that retail traders should stop thinking of options as simple directional bets, and instead view them as predictions on volatility. He dives deep into the difference between implied volatility (IV) and realized volatility (RV) — and explains why these two factors ultimately decide an options trader’s profit or loss over time.

Through practical examples and backtested data, he introduces the concept of the Volatility Risk Premium (VRP). Raghav shows how it has historically played out in markets, why it’s not “free money,” and why risk management is critical to harvesting VRP effectively.

If you want to understand how professionals think about options, volatility, and risk — this episode is packed with insights you won’t want to miss.

Should you Predict the Market for Intraday Trading?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV-vVs6pyr0,vV-vVs6pyr0,"In this video, seasoned trader Arjun Tandon introduces the concept of time-based straddles—a systematic approach to trading where decisions are made based on fixed rules rather than guesses or predictions. Learn how entering trades at specific times like 9:20 AM or 9:30 AM, combined with predefined stop-loss levels such as 20%, 30%, or even 100%, can help manage risk and optimize outcomes.

Arjun presents historical data demonstrating the potential payoffs of such strategies and explains how traders can customize them by setting profit targets, trailing stop-losses, or identifying rule-based re-entry points. This methodical approach encourages discipline and reduces emotional decision-making.

If you’re new to trading and looking for a structured way to start with straddles, this video is a must-watch. Get ready to build a solid foundation for your systematic trading journey.
